# GeoVisualizer
An app to visualize and compare country-wise development in the past and the present.
The app would render geopolitical maps and would showcase information in the form of story slides regarding the evolution of population of countries, dated evolution of wars, territorial expansion of different regions around the world and some extra features like the growth of industrialization around the world.
Basically, if we click on a button, say the population evolution button, it redirects us to the map page which has a population evolution map of the entire world. There would be a drawer icon in the map page which reveals the country selector tab.
We then select the country, after which we can see the map of only that country with a year slider. If we move the slider, we can see the animated evolution of population for that country in the map.
